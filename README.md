# preload-browser
This project provide two Android WebView preload approach:
+ The first approach is pre-initialize a WebView that load url content in One Activity then jump to the other WebView Activity.
+ The second approach is load url content in One Activity via OKHttp and cached, then read cached file in the other WebView Activity.

It depends on your business requirements to select which approach.
